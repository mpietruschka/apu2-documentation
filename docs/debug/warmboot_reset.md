Doubled sign of life
====================

Problem description
-------------------

Sometimes sign of life happens twice. It is caused by reset of platform during
warmboot (doing `rte_ctrl -pon` when the platform is in S5). Problem does
not occur when doing coldboot or reboot.

Initial ideas
-------------

[AGESA specification 44065 Rev. 3.04](https://support.amd.com/TechDocs/44065_Arch2008.pdf)
on page 38 and followings in the operational overview says:

> E â€” Main boot path. Proceed with full hardware initialization.
> Warm reset may be needed to instantiate new values into some registers.

Page 40, about AGESA software call entry points' duties:

```
AmdInitReset
    initialize heap ctl
    Primary ncHt link initialization
    SB initialization @ reset
    NB after HT

AmdInitEarly
    register load
    full HT initialization
    uCode patch load
    AP launch
    PwrMgmt Init
    NB post initialization
    Detect need for warm reset
```

It looks like moving SOL after call to `AmdInitEarly()` would fix the issue,
but then it gets printed after a relatively long period - user might think
that platform isn't booting, also it almost immediately disappears.

Building Debug version of AGESA

Output of boot process with Debug version of AGESA (unrelated lines omitted

It is clear that platrofm resets before `AmdInitEarly()`, somewhere in `AmdInitReset()`.
